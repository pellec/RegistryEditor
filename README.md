# RegistryEditor

This is a web application where you can perform basic crud-operations against the registry on the remote machines that you configure!

It is written using ASP Web API, KnockoutJS, RequireJS, TypeScript and Twitter Bootstrap!

## How to configure servers

To add servers just add server elements in the servers section in the web config. Like so:

      <server name="YourServer" share="YourNetworkShare" user="YourUser" password="YourPassword"/>

Have fun!
